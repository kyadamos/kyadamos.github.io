        <p>in my five years of collegeâ€¦</p>

        <p>i have yet to find a consistent medium for documenting my work. college ruled paper, onenote, google docs, printer paper (still my all time favorite), overleaf, notepad, notepad++, i even tried spreadsheets. i found it difficult to even maintain
            information bases because there were so many different file formats that i was keeping track of; i dreaded redundant documentation more than anything.</p>

        <p>this is my attempt at summarizing what i find interesting and practical.</p>
